torque-tasks prints the number of tasks in the current Torque job for each
or a selected task group.
It is part of the torque-tools package.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP \[bu] 2
Without arguments: Prints the number of tasks for each task
group (each -L argument). This is effectively the value of all 
req_information.task_count lines reported also by qstat.
.IP \[bu]
With a single numeric argument n: Prints the number of tasks for the 
nth task group, i.e., (n+1)st -L argument as Torque counts from 0.
This is effectively the value also reported for req_information.task_count.n. 
In case the argument is not a valid task group number, i.e., larger than or
equal to the number of task groups, nothing is printed and the exit code
is nonzero.
