torque-lprocs prints the number of lprocs per task for the current Torque job.
- Without arguments: Prints the number of lprocs per task allocated for each
  task group (each -L argument) (effectively the value of all 
  req_information.lprocs lines reported also by qstat)
- With a single numeric argument n: Prints the number of lprocs per task 
  for the nth task group (i.e., (n+1)st -L argument as Torque counts from 0)
  (effectively the value also reported for req_information.lprocs.n)
  In case the argument is not a valid task group number (i.e., larger than or
  equal to the number of task groups), nothing is printed and the exit code
  is nonzero.
- torque-lprocs -h or --help shows this help.

All torque-tools:
- torque-tasks: Prints the number of tasks in all or selected task groups
- torque-lprocs: Prints the number of lprocs per task in all or selected task 
  groups
- torque-host-per-line: Prints for each task in all or a selected task group
  the assingned host, one per line. When stored in a file, the output can be
  used with mpirun -machinefile to start hybrid applications.
- torque-hoststring: Prints for each task in all or a selected task group the
  assinged host, as a comma-separated string. 
- torque-parallel: Generates a host list in the format required by GNU
  parallel. Currently this command does not yet support the generation of
  an individual host list for a single task group.
